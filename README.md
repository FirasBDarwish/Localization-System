# Localization-System
Developed as part of Research Assistantship work with the Laboratory of Computer-Human Intelligence headed by Professor Tuka Alhanai.

We are developing a localization (position and rotation tracking) system for use in experimental set-ups and to generate point clouds of fixed 3D euclidean space. 

## Some of the fundamental tasks and overarching objectives of the project:
1. Literature Review: Conduct a wide and thorough evaluation of (a) current, (b) deployable, and (c) streamlined
2. Select
3. Set up hardware for localization system in laboratory setting and prepare instructions for replicating the experimental set-up.
4. Develop a pipeline for receiving and processing 3D data from Vive.
5. Process data using Procrustes Orthogonal Problem to standarize coordinate frames.
6. Apply experimental set-up to mapping problems (diluting 3D euclidean space to control robothand motion).
